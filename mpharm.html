            A Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) degree is a postgraduate degree program in pharmacy that typically takes two years to complete. 
            The program is designed to provide students with advanced training in the field of pharmacy, including the development, production, 
            and use of pharmaceutical drugs. MPharm programs typically include coursework in subjects such as pharmacology, pharmaceutical chemistry,
