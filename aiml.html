            AI&ML— Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)—represents an important evolution in computer science and data processing that is quickly transforming a vast array of industries. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that mimic a human brain and enable them to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.

            Machine learning is a specific form of AI that allows computers to learn and grow after they are introduced to scenarios in the form of data. As businesses and other organizations undergo digital transformation, they’re faced with a growing tsunami of data that is at once incredibly valuable and increasingly burdensome to collect, process and analyze. New tools and methodologies are needed to manage the vast quantity of data being collected, to mine it for insights and to act on those insights when they’re discovered.

            Artificial intelligence and machine learning give organizations a way to extract value out of the troves of data they collect, delivering business insights, automating tasks and advancing system capabilities. AI/ML has the potential to transform all aspects of a business by helping them achieve measurable outcomes including: Increasing customer satisfaction, offering differentiated digital services, Optimizing existing business services, Automating business operations, increasing revenue and reducing costs.
