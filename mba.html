        <p>
            A Master of Business Administration (MBA; also Master in Business Administration) is a professional postgraduate degree focused on business administration. 
            The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business administration; elective courses may allow further study in a particular area but an MBA 
            is normally intended to be a general program. It originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies 
            sought scientific management.

            MBA programs in the United States typically require completing about forty to sixty semester credit hours, much higher than the thirty semester credit hours 
            typically required for other US master's degrees that cover some of the same material. The UK-based Association of MBAs accreditation requires "the equivalent 
            of at least 1,800 hours of learning effort", equivalent to 45 US semester credit hours or 90 European ECTS credits, the same as a standard UK master's degree. 
            Accreditation bodies for business schools and MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education. Business schools in many countries offer programs 
            tailored to full-time, part-time, executive (abridged coursework typically occurring on nights or weekends) and distance learning students, many with specialized 
            concentrations.
