        <h1>Civil Engineering</h1>
        <p>
            Civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for the design, development, and maintenance of both the constructed and the naturally built environment. This includes infrastructure such as airports, bridges, buildings, canals, dams, pipelines, power plants, railways, roads, sewage systems, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Civil engineering projects can come through the public sector, from government agencies, or through the private sector, and can be either large or small in scale, with civil engineers working in fields such as planning, budgeting, project and asset management, research, analysis, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Civil engineering is the second-oldest engineering discipline, after military engineering, having been created to differentiate civilian from military engineering. As a result, it is a broad discipline that is broken down into several sub-disciplines.
        </p>
        <p>
            The broad nature and long history of civil engineering means that its own growth as a discipline is closely associated with the development of human knowledge in areas including physics, mathematics, structures and construction, geography, geology, hydrology, environmental and materials sciences, mechanics, and more.
