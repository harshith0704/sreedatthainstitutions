        <h1>Engineering CSE</h1>
        <p>
            Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is a growing field that merges Computer Science and Engineering. 
            There are more than 6000 colleges across India that offer Computer Science Engineering courses at various 
            levels such as Diploma, Undergraduate, and Postgraduate. In this course, students will get to learn about the 
            design, implementation, and management of information systems of computer hardware and software. The CSE course 
            details cover the inner workings of computer systems and their practical applications. It is like merging the 
            gap between hardware and software components of a computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSE courses offer diverse specialization options like Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Cyber Security, 
            and Software Engineering, allowing students to shape their education to their specific interests and CSE career 
            aspirations. CSE engineers are the masterminds behind various aspects of computing technology - from the design 
            of individual microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers to circuit designing and writing software 
            that powers them.

            Students who have completed their 10+2 with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics and have scored a minimum score 
            of 50 percent (or as prescribed by the institute) are eligible for BTech Computer Science Engineering. For MTech 
            in Computer Science Engineering, the candidates need to complete BTech CSE or a related discipline with the 
            required aggregate score.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most popular entrance exams to get admission in BTech Computer Science Engineering are JEE Main, JEE Advanced, 
            BITSAT, etc. To get admission in MTech CSE, candidates need to clear GATE entrance exam. IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay, 
            BITS Pilani, LPU, etc. are a few of the top CSE colleges in India. Students can do BTech and MTech in CSE from 
            these institutes. Computer Science Engineering salary on average in India is INR 4 LPA.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSE graduates have diverse career opportunities in software development, IT consulting, system analysis and design, 
            network administration, cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. They can work in industries 
            such as technology, finance, healthcare, education, government, and entertainment, among others.
